# Evaka service

## Build and test

Prequisites

- Latest java 11 with JAVA_HOME pointing to it
- Docker

To build `./gradlew build`

## Run

### Start dependencies

Start / setup dependencies with [compose](../compose/README.md):

```sh
docker-compose up db sqs
```

### Start evaka-service

To start the dev server on port 8888:

```sh
./gradlew bootRun
```

To enable hot-swapping run the following command in a separate terminal in addition to the `bootRun` command:

```sh
./gradlew assemble --continuous
```

## Development

### Tests

Run unit tests:

```sh
./gradlew test
```

Run integration tests (needs to have docker daemon running):

```sh
./gradlew integrationTest
```

To start dev server connected to integration test database (suitable for e.g. running E2E tests without cluttering
 development data):
```sh
./gradlew bootRunTest
```
Enable running flyway commands against integration test database in `gradle.properties`

Run linter autofix:

```sh
./gradlew ktlintFormat
```

If you want to set ktlint formatter rules as your IDEA kotlin formatting rules, run:

```sh
./gradlew ktlintApplyToIdea
```

## Dev API

The service has a dev API in local, dev and test environments.
The API is used for creating test fixtures for E2E tests.
The API is defined in [DevApi.kt](src/main/kotlin/fi/espoo/evaka/shared/dev/DevApi.kt).

## Debugging integration tests

At the time being, we use TestContainers for integration tests, so the database lies in a
docker container while the tests are executed. You can access the db with eg.

```sh
docker exec -it <container> psql -U evaka_service_application -d evaka_service
```

where `<container>` is to be found with `docker ps`.

## Varda

Documentation: <https://backend-qa.varda-db.csc.fi/> (You need Voltti, Gofore or Reaktor IP)

### To test against Varda QA server:

- change application-dev.properties file: `fi.espoo.integration.varda.url=https://backend-qa.varda-db.csc.fi/api`
- get apiKey from <https://backend-qa.varda-db.csc.fi/varda/swagger/>
  - login using Opintopolku: See #evaka-tech pinned items
  - change `vardaService.getApiKey()` to return the apiKey

## Tips

### DB migration bookkeeping

Add `./list-migrations.sh` to your *existing* pre-commit hook (`.git/hooks/pre-commit`) to enable automatic DB migration bookkeeping

OR if you don't have a pre-commit hook, you can create a symbolic link to the script with:

```sh
ln -s ../../list-migrations.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
```
