                The application period for clubs that start in the autumn is in
                March. If your child is given a place in a club, you will
                receive a decision in April or May. The decision will cover one
                operating period (from August until the end of May). The
                decision will be sent to the Suomi.fi service or by post if you
                have not activated the service.
              </P>
              <P>
                You can also submit a club application outside of the
                application period and after the clubs’ operating period has
                started. We will, however, first process all applications that
                are submitted during the application period. The applications
                that are submitted outside of the application period will be
                processed in the order in which they are received. The club
                application is for one operating period. At the end of the
                period, the application will be removed from the system.
