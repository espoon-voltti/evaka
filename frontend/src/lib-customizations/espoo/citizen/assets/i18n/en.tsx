                  The application period for clubs that start in the autumn is
                  in March. If your child is given a place in a club, you will

                  one operating period (from August until the end of May). The

                  that are submitted outside of the application period will be
                  processed in the order in which they are received. The club
                  application is for one operating period. At the end of the
