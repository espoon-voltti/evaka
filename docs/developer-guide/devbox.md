# Devbox

Devbox is a personal containerized development environment that sandboxes the
eVaka development tools inside a Docker container. It provides Docker-in-Docker
support and matches your host user's UID/GID for seamless file access.

For setup instructions and configuration, see [.devbox/README.md](../../.devbox/README.md).
