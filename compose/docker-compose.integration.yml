# Docker Compose file that can be used for development builds and that links
# against the development Docker files. Do not mistaken these with production
# docker files that the other compose files deal with.
#
# Tips and Tricks

# a pseudo address docker.for.mac.localhost when running on OXS.
# E.g. to target local application service set APPLICATION_API_URL: http://docker.for.mac.localhost:8080
